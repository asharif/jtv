Intro:

Bash-Fu to grap the top threads in a java pid with ps and associate it with a the first 10 lines of the matching thread in jstack. 
The results are sorted by highest cpu hogs.  Time alive is also shown.  Note that it does not work on OSX and probably no other BSD derivitive.  
Only on GNU/Linux.

Usage:

jtv <pid>
